# is a unique name following the C style variable naming rules but case
# insensitive and including '-'.  The simplest property is a key

# A scalar can have two optional fields: the string 'scalar' and the
# number of values associated with the property.  These are separated
# with ':'.  Specifying the number of values is useful for a property
# that is really a collection of specific values like parameters for a
# reflection model.

# The final property is a string property.  These require the 'string'
# type and follow the C style variable naming convention with the
# inclusion of '-'.
